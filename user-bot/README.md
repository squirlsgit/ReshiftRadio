I want to make this tool generic for every user (with obvious focus on using it for ghali).
This folder should contain all assets related to generate user responses (text and audio). Uploading audio files. Saving response protocols. Etc.

https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/MessageAttachment -- read this to understand how to save an audio file. Can do this locally or through firestore or whatever as long as you understand the encoding. Then you can play it back.
